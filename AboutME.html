        <p>Hi there..
            My name is Sapphire
            I am a pro youtube gamer and a blogger.
            I like coding too!
            My favorite programming language is Python.
            And I am a Harry Potter Fan as well! I like the friendship of Harry, Hermione & Ron.
            <br>
            
            I still remember the 1st conversation they had..</p>
            <pre>
Hermione:	Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.

Ron:		No.

Hermione:	Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.

Ron:		Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!

		{Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}

Hermione:	Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? 
		Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me.
		For example...

		{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. She points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses}

		Oculus Reparo.

		{The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.}

		That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're HarryPotter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?

Ron:		{full mouth} I'm...RonWeasley.

Hermione:	Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.

		{Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.}

		You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there.

		{Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}
